# NZBWeaver 0.1

(This README was generated by a LLM)

**NZBWeaver** is a lightweight command-line tool to retrieve and assemble articles from NZB files on Usenet.  
It’s designed for performance, simplicity, and portability — written in pure C17 with minimal dependencies.

---

## ✨ Features

- Parses NZB files and retrieves referenced articles via NNTP (SSL/TLS supported)
- Decodes YEnc-encoded binaries using **[rapidyenc](https://github.com/animetosho/rapidyenc)**
- Extracts metadata from **PAR2** files for filename verification
- Supports **Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE)** for flexible parsing
- Fast XML parsing via **libexpat**
- Secure network connections via **OpenSSL**

To build NZBWeaver, you’ll need:

- **CMake ≥ 3.10**
- **C17-compatible compiler** (e.g. gcc, clang)
- **OpenSSL**
- **libexpat**
- **libpcre**
- **rapidyenc** (included as a git submodule)

On Arch Linux:
sudo pacman -S openssl expat pcre cmake make gcc

🔧 Building

git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/<yourusername>/NZBWeaver.git
